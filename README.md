## Learning Golang

### 2017-09-01

This readme acts as a blog for Professor Howison's Technology Learning Studio course at the University of Texas at Austin. I'll document my learning process here.

### 2017-09-04

My first learning project is to learn as much as I can of the Go programming language from the [greatercommons.com](greatercommons.com) learning site. The course is called "Learn How to Code: Google's Go (golang) Programming Language" and covers the basics of the language for true beginners of programming.

I've chosen this course because many resources and courses I've found for Go assume that one has no experience with the programming language in particular, but they tend to assume a background in programming or familiarity with another language like Java or C++. I have no background whatsoever in functional programming languages, so many of these would introduce the basics and then quickly lose me with exercises that would assume I knew how to solve a particular programming problem already and that the challenge would be to figure out how to implement it in Go.

My motivation for learning Go is to become familiar with programming languages in general so that I understand their potential and limitations. As a designer, I think this is very important. I also want to continually expand my skillset from a designer and researcher, to a front-end developer, to afull-stack designer and developer. Without a background in programming, I plan to pursue independent projects in programming as a hobby until I've (maybe) reached a point in the future when I could be paid to do it.

The reason I've chosen Go is because, from research I've done, it is considered a very straightforward language with a great emphasis on documentation and simple solutions. While there may be many ways to do something in another language, usually in Go there is only one or very few ways to accomplish something. These constraints, while diminishing freedom or creativity, lower the cognitive load for programmers and lowers the barrier for beginners. These observations are not my own, as I have only learned the basics of Go and have no programming background, but from research I've done online, people to whom I've reached out on Twitter in the Go community, and my software developer friend. Another reason I've decided to learn Go is because of the very engaged and welcoming Go community. The main forum is [https://forum.golangbridge.org/](https://forum.golangbridge.org/), and the main annual conference is [Gophercon](https://www.gophercon.com/). The two or three times that I've reached out to members of the Go community with questions about the language, they have always responded and reached out to their fellow community members to solicit their perspectives as well. In addition to those reasons, Go is very fast, supported by Google, and growing very quickly.

If for some reason I complete the course for Go, I will begin another course on the same Greater Commons site called, "Web Development with Google's Go Programming Language (golang)."

As I complete the course, my "Go Report Card" for the repository can be found [here](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/brentbiglin/greater-commons-go), which checks the format and "lint" of my exercise programs.

#### Topic 1: Go

##### Goal

My simplest goal is to complete the "Learn How to Code: Google's Go (golang) Programming Language" course on the Greater Commons site. This course has 29 sections of about 5-7 lessons each. I believe it's a significant amount of work, but an achievable goal. If I complete this course, my stretch goal is to complete "Web Development with Google's Go Programming Language (golang)," which is also a Greater Commons course. It has 18 sections with the number of lessons ranging from 2 to 24. I am confident that these two courses provide more than enough work for one month.

##### Materials

All that is required is the Go programming language and the $GOPATH with a development environment. I'm using vim with a vim-go plugin, which allows me to format and run Go programs very easily. Each lesson is documented here in the repository.

#### Topic 2: Checkout System with Ponzu CMS and Server Framework

##### Goal

My goal is to create a checkout system or the various devices that are available to students from the IT Lab. Up until now, reservations, checkouts, and overdue devices have been recorded by hand. Presently, a workaround has been developed by the lab TAs to use Google Sheets and Google Forms. An optimized and standardized application developed for the lab's specific needs is required. The tool that I will use does not have a reservation/overdue notice feature, so the bulk of my work will be developing and optimizing that.

##### Materials

I'll be using the [Ponzu CMS and Server Framework](https://docs.ponzu-cms.org/) to develop the application and requested features.

#### Topic 3: Drawing and Sketching

##### Goal

My goal is to make a noticeable improvement in my drawing and sketching abilities, particularly for sketching prototypes and user scenarios. I will sketch and draw a set group of figures/subjects and document my progress and improvement each day.

##### Materials

I've purchased a set of [Uni Pin Drawing Pens](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F38T9C4/) with 6 assorted tip sizes and a [Strathmore Series 400](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0027A39PY) sketch pad.
